VHDL implementation of the FFT-based convolutional algorithm
  Implements a 2D convolution algorithm using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in VHDL. 
  This approach can be very efficient for image processing tasks, as convolution can be performed in the frequency domain to speed up the computation.

If you have specific questions about the implementation, such as VHDL coding techniques, optimization strategies, or details about the FFT algorithm, feel free to ask!
